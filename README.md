## Planning

Gaby and I first came up with the idea to make a Pinball Machine last year at the end of Engineering 4 when we had completed our rocket and were looking for an exciting Capstone project. To begin planning, we made a slideshow with all our essential and nonessential requirements for our project and laid out our plans for how the machine should work and all the necessary steps beforehand. [Here's a link to the Pinball Slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-0p-8omO62feyVH7SRMGAjvP5zyLEiNpoB7CkiigmQg/edit?usp=sharing).
